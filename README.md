# sensonet

sensonet is a library that provides functions to read data from Vaillant heating systems, especially heat pumps, and to initiate certain routines on these systems.
The communication works via the myVaillant portal and the sensonet module (VR921). So you need a Vaillant heating system with a VR921 module and a myVaillant user account.

## Features
- Initalisation of communication to the user account provided 
- Reading which "homes" are available under the user account
- Reading the system information for a selected systemId consisting of configuration data, property data and state data 
- Starting and stopping of hotwater boosts and of zone quick veto sessions

## Getting Started

This project is still in a preliminary state.
